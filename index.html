        <h3><em>About</em></h3>
        <p>The beauty of different cultures.This is my point of view on different cultures all around the world and as we continue to digress along this
            path we should respect and learn peoples culture so as to continue co-existing with one another in harmony
            due to diverse culture not forgrtting religions.We shouldn't judge people from there <strong>religion or even ethnicity</strong> 
            .We should learn to embrace one another for we all have different backgrounds.
            I have a <strong>deep love</strong>for the different cultures and even dishes from different parts of the
            world.Not forgetting that we have so many <strong>interracial couple</strong> that never learnt the cultures of they partners
            and this is passed of as ignorance </p>
